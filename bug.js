This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and trying to access the `takePictureAsync` method before the camera has finished initializing.  This can happen if you call `takePictureAsync` immediately within the `onCameraReady` callback or too soon after mounting the component. The error message may not be particularly descriptive, but the underlying issue is an asynchronous operation that hasn't completed.
