# Expo Camera takePictureAsync Error: Camera Not Ready

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the Expo Camera API's `takePictureAsync` method. The error arises when attempting to capture an image before the camera has fully initialized.

## Problem

The `takePictureAsync` method is called prematurely, resulting in an error that may not be clearly indicated. This often occurs due to the asynchronous nature of camera initialization. The bug.js file showcases this issue.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the camera is fully initialized before invoking `takePictureAsync`.  This is achieved by using the `cameraRef` and a state variable to track camera readiness.  The bugSolution.js file provides the corrected code.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `expo start`.
5. Observe the error in the original code (bug.js) and the corrected behavior in the solution (bugSolution.js).

This example highlights the importance of handling asynchronous operations correctly when working with the Expo Camera API.
